BluSkills are holders of product certification in the delivery of Close Protection services. The bsi kitemark is a symbol of our commitment to excellence and to delivering the highest standards of service to our customers.

The Close Protection service covers both our Security Chauffeur & Close Protection services. Rest assured you're in safe hands. As part of product certification we have to demonstrate our operators are screened to exacting standards, properly trained, licensed and that we are insured.

Put yours and your families safety in companies displaying the British Standards kitemark.
