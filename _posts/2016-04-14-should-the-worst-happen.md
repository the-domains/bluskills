# BluSkills Operators - Trained for emergencies

## Should the worst happen

> In a recent emergency situation the operator had already documented the nearest hospital so I was in A&E within minutes

Trained - Our operators have undergone medical training. This ranges from first person on the scene to more advanced levels of life support and patient care

Supporting You - All our operators carry first aid equipment, allowing us to support you until we reach medical care or until we hand over to the emergency services.
